# Tecbride Foundation Cohort Training

This repository contains my journey and the projects Iâ€™ve completed as part of the Tecbride Foundation Cohort. The syllabus includes various aspects of software engineering, and this repository showcases my work through each module of the course. It focuses on essential technologies and practices to help me build a solid foundation for becoming a full-stack developer.

## Syllabus Overview

The Tecbride Foundation Cohort covers a range of topics designed to equip participants with practical skills in software engineering. Below are some of the key areas covered:

### Modules:
1. **HTML/CSS&Javascript**: Fundamentals of web development.
2. **Advanced JavaScript**: Core programming concepts, problem-solving, and DOM manipulation.
3. **React**: Building dynamic user interfaces using React.js.
4. **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for collaboration and version management.
5. **Backend Development**: Introduction to C# and server-side programming.
6. **Databases**: Basics of relational and non-relational databases, querying, and data modeling.
7. **APIs**: Creating and consuming RESTful APIs.
8. **Deployment**: Deploying applications using services like Heroku, Netlify, and AWS.
9. **Testing**: Writing unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and reliability.

## Getting Started

To start working on projects and exercises from the Tecbride Foundation Cohort, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- A text editor (e.g., VS Code).
- Git for version control.
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
- Node.js (for backend development and running JavaScript locally).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tecbride-foundation-cohort.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
    ```bash
    cd tecbride-foundation-cohort
    ```

3. **Install dependencies** (if applicable, for backend projects):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Open the `index.html` or relevant project file** to explore each project in your browser.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized by module and project. Below is an overview:

- **/module1-html-css**: HTML/CSS projects and exercises.
